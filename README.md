# Music Player
The layout was constructed to be easy and simple to use, from HTML and CSS. Programmed with JavaScript, this music player is able to display a progress bar, which can be controlled by the user, as well as the ability to pause and replay. Webkit was used to avoid browser compatibility issues.
